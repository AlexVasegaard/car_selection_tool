# car_selection_tool

this package is intended as a tool for web scraping relevant alternatives in the selection of a car on the danish second-hand car gallery webpage called "www.bilbasen.dk". 
With this tool, one can automatically identify a set of alternatives, and evaluate them based on the MCDM evaluation methods of topsis, fuzzy topsis, AHP, electre, and WSA with whatever preference structure that fits the User.
Additionally the corresponding pareto front with the corresponding a priori defined preferences can be visulalized in an interactive plot. 

Here is an example of a plot.
